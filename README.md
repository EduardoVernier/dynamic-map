Java implementation of treemapping techniques

For the past 26 years, a great number of treemapping techniques have been proposed. Many of which have been designed with objectives such as producing good aspect ratios or preserving the order in the data in mind. Yet, only few techniques have been envisioned to deal with dynamic hierarchical datasets and sensibly respond to change in the data.
This repository has the implementation of four treemapping techniques along with their variations: Squarified Treemap, Slice-and-Dice, Ordered Treemap, and Nmap.
